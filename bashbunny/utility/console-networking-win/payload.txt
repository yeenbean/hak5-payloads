# Title:        Networking Console (Windows)
# Description:  Allows you to access the Bash Bunny console with access to the
#               host machine's network. You will need to enable network sharing
#               on your local network adapter to share to the BB's network
#               adapter. Additionally, you will need to set a static IP on the
#               BB adapter to 172.16.64.64/24 and leave the router and DNS
#               fields blank.
#               Additionally, the CPU governor is adjusted to use only one CPU
#               core (CUCUMBER ENABLE). This reduces heat and extended use won't
#               put wear on your BB.
