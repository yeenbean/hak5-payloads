# Title:        Networking Console (Windows)
#
# Description:  This simple payload allows you to access the Bash Bunny console
#               with access to the host machine's network.
#
#               There are a few required configuration steps on the host
#               machine. In order for the Bash Bunny to communicate with the
#               Internet, you will need to enable network sharing between the
#               device and your local network. Additionally, you must set a
#               static IP on the Bash Bunnyâ€™s network adapter to 172.16.64.64/24
#               and leave the router and DNS fields blank.
#
#               To protect the device, the CPU governor is adjusted to use only
#               one CPU core (CUCUMBER ENABLE). This reduces heat and extended
#               use won't put wear on your Bash Bunny.
